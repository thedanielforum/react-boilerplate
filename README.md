This is usally the structure I use for `non server rendered` react applications.
I have used this structure for over a year in ten's of projects big & small and for me it has been working quite well, so this is why I have decided to publish it in the hopes that I can serve as a good starting point for other people as well.

If you have any questions or ideas for improvement please feel free to open a [issue](https://github.com/thedanielforum/react-boilerplate/issues).
